Crypto is the medium upon which society will build the next generation of digital institutions. Valenceâ€™s purpose is to maximize long-term, permissionless collaboration by increasing the scope and scale of these digital institutions.

By its nature, digitization reduces fidelity. Thus, digital protocols are inherently limited in what they can express. Limited expressibility reduces the degree to which a protocol can represent its constituents. 

Constituents are better served by protocols that are specifically designed to account for the context of their communities. Through bottom-up coordination around shared goals, many high-context protocols can achieve greater scale than fewer low-context monoliths.

There are already a variety of projects that bridge messages and security between protocols. Valence bridges economics and politics between protocols. To achieve this economic and political bridging, Valence enables protocol-to-protocol lending because lending has the capacity to build trust and generate positive-sum outcomes.
