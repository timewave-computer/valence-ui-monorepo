These are a small subset of files extracted from the telescope codegen.

The codebase only uses `MsgExecute` and `Instantiate2`, so only those protobuf types and amino types were extracted, as well as all helper dependencies.

To generate more telescope files, create a folder for protobuf files, and `gen:cosmos-proto`
