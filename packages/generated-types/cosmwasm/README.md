# Cosmwasm generated types

We use json contract schema + cosmology ts codegen to generate types for contract responses.

Run generate.ts in this folder. Execution is in the package.json scripts

## Adding schema

Add file with same folder structure in contract-schema, add path in generate.ts, and run with `turbo prep`
